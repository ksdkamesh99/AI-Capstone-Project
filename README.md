## About the repository:-
1 . This Repository contains the 4 week AI Capstone project assignment using keras as a part of IBM-AI Engineering in which we need to classify a image containing a stone cracked or not by processing 40000 images in which nearly 30000 for training and 10000 for validation.  
2 . 4th week is final assignment in which we need to campare performance in between pretrained models like Resnet50 and VGG16 using keras.

## Performance of Models:-

I ran both models to 2 epochs. Performance is as shown in below table.

| Model          | Training Accuracy | Validation Accuracy | Test Accuracy  | Valdation Loss | Training Loss   | 
|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Resnet 50      | 91.08%            | 93.88%              | 54.19          | 0.0016         | 0.0070          |
| VGG16          | 99.76%            | 99.81%              | 98.0%          | 7.4741e-05     | 0.0074          |

## Conclusion:-
In the 2 models by the above data we can conclude VGG16 is appropriate for the above dataset. After all my final assignment is passed and graded 100%.
