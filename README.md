## About the repository:-

1. This Repository contains the 4 week AI Capstone project assignment using keras as a part of IBM-AI Engineering in which we need to classify a image containing a stone cracked or not by processing 40000 images in which nearly 30000 for training and 10000 for validation.  


2. 4th week is final assignment in which we need to campare performance in between pretrained models like Resnet50 and VGG16 using keras

## Performance of Models:-

I ran both models to 2 epochs. Performance is as shown in below table.

|                | Training Accuracy | Validation Accuracy|Test Accuracy|Valdation Loss|Training Loss|Testing Loss|
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| Resnet 50      | 91.08%            |           93.88%           |      54.19       |    0.0016       |     0.0070         |     3.488461971282959|
| VGG16          | 99.76%            |99.81%                |      98.0%        |      7.4741e-05    |      0.0074        |0.06328427046537399|


## Conclusion:-

In the 2 models by the above data we can conclude VGG16 is appropriate for the above dataset. After all my final assignment is passed and graded 100%.
